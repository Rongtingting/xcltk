This folder contains feature annotation files of common genomic versions.
These pre-compiled files can be used in several xcltk commands, including
`xcltk allelefc (-r/--region)` and `xcltk basefc (-r/--region)`.
The key part of the files are their first 4 columns:

- chrom : str; chromosome name of the feature.
- start : int; start (genomic) position of the feature, 1-based and inclusive.
- end : int; end (genomic) position of the feature, 1-based and inclusive.
- name : str; name of the feature.
